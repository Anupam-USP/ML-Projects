## Getting Started

These instructions will help you to build up the environment to build a copy of the project up and running on your system.

### Prerequisites
To run this project on your system, you need following softwares and python module installed on your system:

* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas (For manipulating dataset)
* OpenCV (For manipulating images)
 
If you don't have the above you can install the with following commands 

(For linux you need to use `pip3` and for windows use `pip`)
```
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install matplotlib
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install opencv-python
```

## Projects
Here are the list of projects I implemented  under the machine learning:
1. [Air quality index](Air%20quality%20index/) : Model used **Linear Regression**
2. [Chemical Segregation](Chemical%20Segregation/) : Model used **Logistics Regression Classifier**
3. [Instagram Collage](Instagram%20Collage/) : Tried to implement OpenCV methods to manipulate images
4. [Movie Recommendation System](Movie%20Recommendation%20System/) : Tried with the help of pandas, to recreate
youtube/google like recommendation system (Though with some constraints)
