## Getting Started

These instructions will help you to build up the environment to build a copy of the project up and running on your system.

### Prerequisites
To run this project on your system, you need following softwares and python module installed on your system:

* Numpy (For mathematical formulations)
* Matplotlib (For visualisation)
* Pandas (For manipulating dataset)
* OpenCV (For manipulating images)
* Sklearn (For implementing certain algorithms)

If you don't have the above you can install the with following commands

(For Linux you need to use `pip3` and for windows use `pip`)
```
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install matplotlib
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install opencv-python
pip3 install sklearn
```

## Projects
Here are the list of projects I implemented  under the machine learning:
1. [Air quality index](Air%20quality%20index/) : Model used **Linear Regression**
2. [Chemical Segregation](Chemical%20Segregation/) : Model used **Logistics Regression Classifier**
3. [Instagram Collage](Instagram%20Collage/) : Tried to implement OpenCV methods to manipulate images
4. [Movie Recommendation System](Movie%20Recommendation%20System/) : Tried with the help of pandas, to recreate
youtube/google like recommendation system (Though with some constraints)
5. [Movie review sentiment analysis](Movie%20review/): Analysis of the sentiments in movie review with **Naive bayes classifier**
and nltk toolkit.
6. [Color Extraction](Color%20Extraction/): Extracting dominant colors from the given image using **k-Means clustering**.
7. [Automatic Codechef submission](Automatic%20codechef%20submission/): Automatic codechef submission with selenium.
