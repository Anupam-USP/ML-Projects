# Description
I used linear regression model to train the dataset, however without the help of sklearn functions. 
They are of better working as rather than iterating, I used the numpy modules. Training is done in `pred_algo.py`
and the output can be done through `prediction.py`. The datasets I used are also attached.

## Requirements
Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib and numpy are must to be installed.
